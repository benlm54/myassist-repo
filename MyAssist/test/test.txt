That's the risk of being productive :-) I'll be back in Boulder at about 1:00 tomorrow - let's talk in the lab. 
In the mean time, it would be useful to start documenting everything we've done for eventual inclusion in the final report, 
including any graphs, screenshots, etc. 
On next project, there are a number of possibilities floating around - let's talk when you have a few minutes.

Thanks,
Curt
